1. Download InsightEdge zip file, this project now is using InsightEdge 2.1 GA for measurement purposes
2. Then go to sbin directory, define number of workers ( by using environment variable SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES ) and run InsightEdge in demo mode: export SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=4 and then ./insightedge.sh --mode demo
3. gs-ui can be run in order to check that everything is running properly
4. Now submit LoadData by running following command from bin directory ( 1st parameter is list of csv file to load delimetered by comma, the 2nd parameter is using parallelism number ):
    ./insightedge-submit --class nyctaxi.LoadData --master spark://127.0.0.1:7077 /home/evgeny/dev/workspace/MyNYTaxi/target/nytaxi-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /home/evgeny/Downloads/csvs/yellow_tripdata_2016-01.csv 4
5. Pease verify in gs-ui space has nyctaxi.TaxiTripData objects
5. Load time result must be taken from following place in log:
    DataFrame load took 77157 msec.
7. Now submit ReadData by running following command from bin directory: ./insightedge-submit --class nyctaxi.ReadData --master spark://127.0.0.1:7077 /home/evgeny/dev/workspace/MyNYTaxi/target/nytaxi-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
8. Write time result must be taken from following place in log:
    DataFrame load took 31198 msec.
